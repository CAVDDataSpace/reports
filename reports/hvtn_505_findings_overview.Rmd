analysisdata <- dem505 %>%
    filter(trt == 1) %>%
    select(pub_id, trt, case,
           age, gender, racefull,
           BMI, BMIcat, bhvrisk) %>%
    inner_join(bamAnt, by = "pub_id") %>%
    inner_join(icsPfs, by = "pub_id") %>%
    mutate(age_std = scale(age),
           bmi_std = scale(BMI),
           bhvrisk_std = scale(bhvrisk))

## subset to white or Black or African American

## rm na values from table for IgG_env and CD8+_PFS
analysisdata <- analysisdata[!is.na(analysisdata$CD8_env_PFS) &
                             !is.na(analysisdata$IgG_C.con.env03140CF_avi),]

```

```{r notes1, eval = F, include = F}

## *DEVIATION NOTES*


## * There are NA values in my CD8_env_PFS subseting table to exclude those records.
## * Nowhere near as many bama antigens used
## * BAMA parameter is not the same as used in original analysis, it's a different value than `mfi_blank`, log transforming `mfi_blank`

```

## Logistic regressions

Logistic regression was performed using a generalized linear model for significance testing. Notes about each test and their results are found below.

### Logistic regression on CD8 ENV polyfunctionality

* Odds ratio is `exp(<estimate>)`, in this case `exp(-1.220)` = 0.295
* p-value for CD8 env is 0.0005

```{r logit1}

fit_cd8env <- glm(case ~ age_std + bmi_std + bhvrisk_std +
                      racefull + scale(CD8_env_PFS),
                  family = binomial(link = 'logit'),
                  data = analysisdata)

knitr::kable(coef(summary(fit_cd8env)))

```

### Logistic regression for the single best antigen from BAMA.

* Odds ratio is 0.587
* p-value is 0.014

```{r logit5}

fit_bestsingle <- glm(case ~ age_std + bmi_std + bhvrisk_std + racefull +
                          scale(IgG_C.con.env03140CF_avi),
                      family = binomial(link = 'logit'),
                      data = analysisdata)

knitr::kable(coef(summary(fit_bestsingle)))

```

### Logistic regression including both CD8 ENV polyfunctionality and best single BAMA antigens well as an interaction term.

* CD8 ENV polyfunctionality is significant.

```{r logit4}

fit_cross <- glm(case ~ age_std + bmi_std + bhvrisk_std + racefull +
                     scale(IgG_C.con.env03140CF_avi) * scale(CD8_env_PFS),
                family = binomial(link = 'logit'),
                data = analysisdata)

knitr::kable(coef(summary(fit_cross)))

```

### Logistic regression including both CD8 ENV polyfunctionality and best single BAMA antigen.

```{r logit6}

fit_bestsingle_cd8env <- glm(case ~ age_std + bmi_std + bhvrisk_std + racefull + 
                                 scale(IgG_C.con.env03140CF_avi) + scale(CD8_env_PFS),
                             family = binomial(link = 'logit'),
                             data = analysisdata)

knitr::kable(coef(summary(fit_bestsingle_cd8env)))

```
